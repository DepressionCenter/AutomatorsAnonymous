## About the Team
The Power Automate Lab started as a means to collaborate and problem-solve together. It is comprised of Power Platform users from different business, research and IT positions throughout Michigan Medicine and University of Michigan. We jokingly called our first in-person meeting the "Automators Anonymous" meeting, so the name seemed fitting for this code repository.
